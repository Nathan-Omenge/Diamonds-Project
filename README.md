# Diamonds-Project
An analysis of the diamonds inbuilt dataset in R;

This project contains tasks related to analyzing the `diamonds` dataset using statistical and visualization methods. It demonstrates the application of key statistical techniques and data visualization using R.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Dataset Exploration**:
   - Examined the structure and variables of the `diamonds` dataset.
   - Summarized the dataset's attributes such as `carat`, `cut`, `color`, `clarity`, `depth`, and `price`.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculated descriptive summaries for variables: `price`, `carat`, `width (x)`, and `depth`.
   - Grouped data by `cut` and `clarity` to obtain:
     - Average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each variable.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Generated bar charts to display the proportion of diamonds across different cuts and clarity levels.
   - Used `ggplot2` for enhanced visualizations and insights.

4. **Code Explanation**:
   - Provided detailed annotations for R code used in the analysis, including functions like `group_by()`, `summarise()`, and visualization functions.
